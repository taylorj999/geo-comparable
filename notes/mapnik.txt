1. The latest version of mapnik is 3.7.2, but fails to build on windows (apparently a misconfiguration of the install script?).
The last mapnik version to have a precompiled binary for windows is 3.6.2, which necessitates its use here.

See: https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik#windows-specific

2. mapnikify for converting geoJSON to mapnik XML has some dependency issues which for now can be resolved using a local fork

local linking:

[From the npm-link documentation:

In the local module directory:

$ cd ./package-dir
$ npm link

In the directory of the project to use the module:

$ cd ./project-dir
$ npm link package-name

Or in one go using relative paths:

$ cd ./project-dir
$ npm link ../package-dir

This is equivalent to using two commands above under the hood.]

4. mapnik @mapbox components sometimes require GDAL libraries, however the auto-install of GDAL seems to not work
properly. Adding gdal 0.9.6 explicitly to the package.json seems to have resolved the errors.

5. The last version of mapnik that can be easily set up for windows (v3.6.2) now also requires no higher a node version than v8.16.0.
As linux is able to run higher versions of mapnik without issue, development on windows is no longer recommended.
