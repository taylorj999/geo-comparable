1. ogr2ogr currently distributed as part of the GDAL package at

http://www.gisinternals.com/query.html?content=filelist&file=release-1911-x64-gdal-2-2-3-mapserver-7-0-7.zip

2. ogr2ogr requires the GDAL_DATA environment variable to be set (standard would be C:\Program Files\GDAL\gdal-data)

setx GDAL_DATA "C:\Program Files\GDAL\gdal-data"

3. ogr2ogr data load syntax

ogr2ogr -f "MySQL" MYSQL:"SCHEMANAME,host=localhost,user=USER,password=PASSWORD,port=3306" -nln "TABLENAME" -t_srs "EPSG:4326" C:\Development\gis\file_to_import.shp

The option ( -t_srs "ESPG:4326" ) imports the data in lat-long coordinates.

The options ( -skipfailures ) may be needed for importing parcel data because of some very large parcels in the dataset
owned by the local government and thus not relevant to the application.

4. ogr2ogr does not use significant CPU time but is exceedingly slow

Loading the parcel data file (60mb) takes approximately 1 hour
